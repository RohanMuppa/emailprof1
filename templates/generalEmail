        Greetings Professor [lastName],
    </p>

    <p>
        I hope this email finds you well. My name is Rohan Muppa, and I will be a senior at Skyline High School this fall. I am eager to express my passion for the fields of computer and environmental sciences. As I embark on my final year of high school, I am actively seeking a valuable research opportunity this summer.
    </p>

    <p>
        While looking through some of the research at [school], I came across your work in the [area] field, which impressed me and led me to believe that you would be the perfect mentor for the project I am pursuing. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the application of machine learning techniques and remote sensing data for water quality monitoring.
    </p>

    <p>
        In my project, I tried to analyze chlorophyll-a concentration and Sea Surface Temperature (Â°C) as independent variables and predict the quantity of K. brevis cells as the dependent variable. I used the historical quantities of K. brevis cells to train and evaluate the machine learning algorithm. Your experience [experience]

        I have attached my updated <a href="https://issaquahwednet-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/mupproh24_issaquah_wednet_edu/EXlnaN6z_MpKjzD7n2HAmzoBLCb3WGksSEWG7SgybdS3Gw?e=aBdzTu">CV</a> which provides a comprehensive overview of my academic achievements. I assure you that I will not hinder any process and will require minimal training. I will perform any tasks assigned to me. I would greatly appreciate it if I were given any opportunity to gain experience this summer.
    </p>

        Thank you in advance for your time and consideration. Looking forward to your response.
