        Greetings Professor [lastName],
    </p>

    <p>
        I hope this email finds you well. My name is Rohan Muppa, and I will be a senior at Skyline High School this fall. I am eager to express my passion for the fields of computer and environmental sciences. As I embark on my final year of high school, I am actively seeking a valuable research opportunity this summer.

        During my research on [school], I came across your work in the [area] field, which impressed me and led me to believe that you would be the perfect mentor for the project I am pursuing. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the application of machine learning techniques and remote sensing data for water quality monitoring in estuaries.

        In my previous work, I employed XGBoost models to analyze chlorophyll-a concentration and Sea Surface Temperature (Â°C) as independent variables. These data were sourced from NASA Ocean Color which estimated these values from NASA MODIS Aqua satellite data. Predicting the quantity K. brevis cells as the dependent variable, I utilized historical quantities of K. brevis to train and evaluate the model's performance. Your experience [experience]

        I have attached my updated <a href="https://issaquahwednet-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/mupproh24_issaquah_wednet_edu/EXlnaN6z_MpKjzD7n2HAmzoBLCb3WGksSEWG7SgybdS3Gw?e=aBdzTu">CV</a> which provides a comprehensive overview of my academic achievements. I assure you that I will not hinder any process and will require minimal training. I will perform any tasks assigned to me. I would greatly appreciate it if I were given any opportunity fellow to gain experience this summer.
